# Software Rasterizer

This program is an imitation of the OpenGL API pipeline, but it only writes to a TGA file.
I wrote it to express my understanding of the rasterization pipeline. I learned many things along the way and I hope you like it.

## Features

- Rasterization of 3D models to 2D images
- Z-Buffering
- Texture mapping
- Perspective and orthographic projection
- Virtual camera
- Bottom-right rule to break ties between adjacent triangles
- Color interpolation
- Export results to images

## Installation

Clone the repository and build the project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YassinRamadan1/Software-Rasterizer.git
cd Software-Rasterizer
```

## Usage

1. Create a `Camera` object, a `FrameBuffer` object, and a `Rasterizer` object. Initialize the rasterizer with vectors of positions, faces, texture coordinates, or colors.
2. Specify the projection type, wrapping, and texture filtering methods, as well as the projection, view, and model matrices.
3. Call the `.process()` method, then `.draw()` from the `Rasterizer` object.
4. To save the image, call `write_Color_as_tga_file()` from the `FrameBuffer` object.

## Screenshots / Results

Below are results generated by the rasterizer (located in the `Export` folder):

![Diablo Model](assets/Diablo.tga)
*Textured 3D model from a game.*

![BoggieMan Model](assets/BoggieMan.tga)
*Another 3D model.*

![African Head](assets/AfricanHead.tga)
*Yet another model.*

![Rotated African Head](assets/RotatedAfricanHead.tga)
*The previous model, rotated around the Y-axis.*

![Regular Triangle](assets/RegularTriangle.tga)
*A triangle with interpolated vertex colors.*

![Projected Triangle](assets/ProjectedTriangle.tga)
*The same triangle, with the blue vertex moved further from the camera. Perspective-correct interpolation causes the blue to diminish more quickly.*
